          About Me
        </div>
        <p>
           &#8195;My name is <b>Kayden La</b>. I began taking college classes since Spring 2020. I officially graduated high school Fall of 2021. This is my second year at <b><i>The University of Houston</i></b>. I am majoring in <i>Computer Information Systems</i> (CIS). My interest in coding began at a very young age: I have always enjoyed the idea of design creation. During the year of 2016, I played a popular FPS game, Minecraft, that encouraged custom modding. That year I downloaded and heavily modded that game. However, it was only till the latter half of that year that I began developing my own mods.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8195;Thus, my coding experience began on the addition / customization of the Java based video game, <i>Minecraft</i>. Since my time working on Minecraft mods, I have thus tinkered with C++, SQL, Python, and HTML (in progress).
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8195;I am currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification, which I will complete by the end of 2022. I will graduate Spring 2025. Currently, I am a sales consultant for Samsung INC. After Fall 2022 semester ends, I will apply to server administration jobs. For my future goals, I strive to become a network engineer.
