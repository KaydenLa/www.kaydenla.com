                    <p class="card-text">
                      My tech journy began by my initial fascination for video game modding. Initially, I followed online coding tutorials and experimented with creating mods for Minecraft in 2014. As my skills developed, I began to explore other areas of technology.<br>
                      By 2015, my interest in computer components peaked when the screen on my laptop needed repair. While solving this issue I followed tutorials on how to safely work on personal computers.<br>
                      By 2021, I had developed a new interest in networking equipment and portforwarding.<br>
                      By 2022, I expanded my skill set by learning CSS, HTML, and Python.<br>
                      By 2023 I delved into responsive bootstrap design and MySQL. Additionally, I focused on full-stack development by learning NodeJS, EJS, MySQL connector, Flask, and WSGI-mod for Apache.<br>
                      Overall, my passion for technology has been a driving force in my personal and professional development.

                      I plan to continue broading my overall tech knowledge while continuing on my path towards my very long term goal of becoming a network architect.<br>
                      Along my path towards this goal, I expect many differing oppurtunities within tech to arrise as my intersts narrow and become more and more marketable.<br>
                      As the tech market changes, I am willing to redifine my long-term goals and areas of focus.
